What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
Prior to the GPS session I was unclear about the GitHub process of pushing changes.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
In this GPS 1.1 both the Git workflow & GitHub workflow were clarified - creating & cloning a repo, creating a feature branch, making pull requests, fetching & merging, & resolving merge conflicts.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I asked many questions to my pair & my guide - I tried to direct questions I felt were implied in our coursework so far to my pair & those beyond it to my guide.

What still confuses you about Git?
I wonder if the GUI or Finder can only view or access the master branch of a repo.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
My first experience was positive, we conversed like we were in the same room, my guide was supportive & my pair helped me practice good Git & GitHub workflows.
