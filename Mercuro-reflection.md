# reflection
*Understanding moving through branches and how they relate to gitHub
*Practice with git workflow and github workflow
*Questions about code review and questions about pull requests
*Where branches are nested, and if branches can only be accessed throught the command line
*I thought it went pretty well, it feels like we were in the same room.
